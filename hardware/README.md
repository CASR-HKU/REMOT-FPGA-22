# REMOT hardware
## Outlines
- hls: HLS code and vivado scripts for bitfile generation
- drive: python drive for running hardware test
- eval: some helpful script for accuracy evalution

## Instructions to run the hardware test
- If you want to reproduce the bitfiles. Go the ./hls and follow the README instructions there. The output bitstream will automatically export to the drive folder.
- The ./drive folder already contains all the prebuilt bitstreams. When you are ready, pack everything and upload to the development boards
- You can download the running results (videos and tracking results) from development boards and evaluate using scripts in ./eval
